####<img src="https://github.com/favicon.ico" width="35">  Starting with Github
Congratulations! Since you are reading this, you have accomplised the first step in your onboarding process - accessing our Github site! You are inside what is called a repository (repo for short). Each repo on the NYU mHealth site is associated with a research project or topic where files, code, and documentation can be updated and managed. Git is the current software leader for [version control](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). But more on that later...

The next step to becoming an NYU mHealth team member is creating your avatar! Yes, we know it's whimsical, but believe us, it serves a purpose. You'll see. For now, download one of the following apps (or add your favorite to the list!), create your avatar, and send it as a .png or .jpg to holly.orr@nyu.edu or sasha.guttentag@nyu.edu.

- Bitmoji (App)

As we create the website, we'd like to include mini-bios about all of our members - along with the avatars (see above). Here an example bio just so you have a sense of what we're going for:

*Jane Doe is an Epidemiology MPH student at the NYU College of Global Public Health. Her interests include geospatial analysis and predictive behavior modeling. Within the mHealth Lab, she is currently focused on QA testing of mobile surveying software and cross-collaborative project management.* 

####<img src="https://github.com/nyu-mhealth/Onboarding/blob/master/Images/brainstorming-icon.png" width="50">  The Culture
We are a team that thrives on collaboration. We honor our unique backgrounds, expertise, and insights. There are no "dumb" questions or answers. No one is born knowing how to use Jira, build a log-linear model, program in Python, or develop the best research protocol. 

We like to say if you meet someone that is born knowing how to do *everything* then [they are probably some sort of AI from the future](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/The_Terminator) and you should run-away as fast as possible! 

So ask questions! Fail fast and often! And teach your teammates when you can!

In the spirit of collaboration and innovation, we have borrowed a project management method/framework that started in Silicon Valley, but has become popular in organizations outside the tech sector: Agile/Scrum.  It's how we run meetings and organize our team. So you will learn by osmosis - *don't sweat it*! But, if you would like to learn more...click here.
