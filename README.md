####Starting with Github
Congratulations! Since you are reading this, you have accomplised the first step in your onboarding process - accessing our Github site! You are inside what is called a repository (repo for short). Each repo on the NYU mHealth site is associated with a research project or topic where files, code, and documentation can be updated and managed. Git is the current software leader for [version control](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control). But more on that later...

####Avatar
The next step to becoming an NYU mHealth team member is creating your avatar! Yes, we know it's whimsical, but believe us, it serves a purpose. You'll see. For now, download one of the following apps (or add your favorite to the list!), create your avatar, and send it as a .png or .jpg to holly.orr@nyu.edu or sasha.guttentag@nyu.edu.
