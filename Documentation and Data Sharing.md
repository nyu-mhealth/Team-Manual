####Where Do I Put This?
We are still working out the kinks on this one (it's hard people). With your help, we will come up with the best solution for our work, research, and team. Here's a first go:

**NYU mHealth Google Drive**

What goes here:

    - Project documents  
    - Papers  
    - IRB materials  
    - Research  
    - Meeting notes
    
Why does it go here:

    - NYU is a Google Apps for Ed instution
    - Faculty, staff, and students understand how it works (it's intuitive)
    - Easy to share with internal and external collaborators

**NYU Box**
Data that is under IRB - Non-Anonymous human subject data

**NYU mHealth Github**
Code and internal documentation that will get updated often (like this manual)
