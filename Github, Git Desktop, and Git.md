##Version Control and Git

In case you don't know what version control is and why we use it, [watch this](http://git-scm.com/video/what-is-version-control) and then come back.

There are [many choices](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comparison_of_version_control_software) in the version control market. At NYU mHealth, we used Git. 

###What's the Diff?
Now you are saying, what's the difference between Git, Git Desktop, and Github? 

**Git** is the actual version control system, a tool to manage your source code history. 
**GitHub** is a hosting service for Git repositories. 

So they are not the same thing: 
- Git = tool 
- GitHub = a web service for projects that use Git

Git it (haha)? If you are still confused, watch this.
