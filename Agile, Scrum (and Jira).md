    agÂ·ile: adjective 
    
        1. able to move quickly and easily. 
        "Ruth was as agile as a monkey."  
        synonyms: nimble, lithe, supple, limber, acrobatic, fleet-footed, light-footed, light on one's feet  
        
        2. relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development,  
        that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment   
        and adaptation of plans.
        "agile methods replace high-level design with frequent redesign"  

Once upon a time, we thought we could plan ahead for everything (LOL). But then [Moore's Law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) got in the way. For years we fell down a [waterfall](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BySL4iPkCvi4ejhwVHdiTm5fbjQ) (punn intended). The weird thing is - we followed a plan that was really meant to be a warning (really you got to read [*this*](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BySL4iPkCvi4ejhwVHdiTm5fbjQ) - it's insane). As a result, a bunch of brilliant (and frusturated) developers came together to create a framework that could best answer the riddle "how do you manage a team in a world of constant change?". The answer: [The Agile Manifesto] (http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). I know, the "official web page" looks like your mom's blog post - but be nice... with age, comes wisdom (and content > presentation).

OK. Good point (says you - after you read [this](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BySL4iPkCvi4ejhwVHdiTm5fbjQ). But how do I implement an Agile approach to my work? Well... there are many frameworks. We chose [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum), but there are many other choices: (Kanban, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development...). BTW - Tell us why would we should pivot to another... we are alway opens to change (agile). The moral of the story for this module is:
