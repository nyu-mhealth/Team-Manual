    agÂ·ile: adjective 
    
        1. able to move quickly and easily. 
        "Ruth was as agile as a monkey."  
        synonyms: nimble, lithe, supple, limber, acrobatic, fleet-footed, light-footed, light on one's feet  
        
        2. relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development,  
        that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment   
        and adaptation of plans.
        "agile methods replace high-level design with frequent redesign"  

Once upon a time, we thought we could plan ahead for everything (LOL). But then [Moore's Law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) got in the way. For years we fell down a [waterfall](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf) (punn intended). The weird thing is - we followed a plan that was really meant to be a warning (really you got to read [*this*](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf) - it's insane). As a result, a bunch of brilliant (and frusturated) developers came together to create a framework that could best answer the riddle "how do you manage a team in a world of constant change?". The answer: [The Agile Manifesto] (http://www.agilemanifesto.org/principles.html). We know, the "official web page" looks like your mom's blog post - but be nice... with age, comes wisdom (and content > presentation).

OK. Good point (says you - after you read [**what we told you to read above**)](Agile.vs.Waterfall.pdf). 

####Scrum

        "But how do I implement an Agile approach to my work?"

Well... there are frameworks for Agile that help you set some rules and steps for humans to follow. The idea with Agile is that you can choose rules... and then break them to fit your needs (we call it "peaceful anarchy" ). Currently, we are in the  [Scrum](https://www.scrumalliance.org/why-scrum) tribe, but there are many other choices: (Kanban, Extreme Programming, Adaptive Software Development...). BTW - Tell us why would we should pivot to another... we are alway opens to change (Agile). But for now...

        Scrum is an Agile framework for completing complex projects. Scrum originally was formalized for  
        software development projects, but it works well for any complex, innovative scope of work.   
        The possibilities are endless. The Scrum framework is deceptively simple.

What?? That makes it clear as mud. Yea, we know. Welcome to the world of tech documentation. So, let's break it down to the parts of Scrum we currently practice at NYU mHealth:
- Sprint: 
- Weekly Scrum:
- Jira:
- Agile Board:

As we grow and learn as a team, we will add more Scrum/Agile elements to our process - hey we're learning all this too! If you want to learn more about Agile and Scrum, here are a list of resources we suggest (remember to feel free to add any you find)!
