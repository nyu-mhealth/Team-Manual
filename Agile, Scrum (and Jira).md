    agÂ·ile: adjective 
    
        1. able to move quickly and easily. 
        "Ruth was as agile as a monkey."  
        synonyms: nimble, lithe, supple, limber, acrobatic, fleet-footed, light-footed, light on one's feet  
        
        2. relating to or denoting a method of project management, used especially for software development,  
        that is characterized by the division of tasks into short phases of work and frequent reassessment   
        and adaptation of plans.
        "agile methods replace high-level design with frequent redesign"  

Once upon a time, we thought we could plan ahead for everything. But then [Moore's Law] (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Moore%27s_law) got in the way. For years we fell down a [waterfall](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/0BySL4iPkCvi4ejhwVHdiTm5fbjQ) (punn intended). The weird thing is - we followed a plan that was really meant to be a warning (really you got to read *this* - it's insane). As a result, a bunch of brilliant (and frusturated) developers came together to create a framework that could best answer the riddle "how do you create a plan in a world of change?". The answer: The Agile Manifesto.

OK. Good point (says you). But how do I implement an Agile approach to my work? Well... there are many frameworks. The most popular is Scrum
