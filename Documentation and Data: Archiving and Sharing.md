####Where Do I Put This?
We are still working out the kinks on this one (it's hard people). With your help, we will come up with the best solution for our work, research, and team. Here's a first go:

####N<img src="/Images/Google-Drive-Icon.ico" width="70">  NYU mHealth Google Drive

What goes here:

    - Project documents  
    - Papers  
    - IRB materials  
    - Research  
    - Meeting notes
    
Why does it go here:

    - NYU is a Google Apps for Ed instution
    - Faculty, staff, and students understand how it works (it's intuitive)
    - Easy to share with internal and external collaborators
