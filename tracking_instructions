#### As part of MapMob testing, we are looking to test geolocation across platforms. But we can only do so if we have people tracking! 

## How can you help and be part of the research?  
#### 1. Track with MapMob:
        - download the most updated MapMob app version 1.0.47
        - go to settings -- > location --> always 
        - go to the MapMob app: create an account --> on the right corner: acrivate tracking 
        
        
#### 2. Allow Google Timeline: 
        - download both google maps and the google app
        - in your phone settings - google maps --> location --> choose always
        - google app - press on the left corner of the page (your photo) 
        - privacy --> location --> location reporting -choose--> report from this device - done
     *   make sure your gmail account is the same in the app and online
     **  to see your timeline, go to the desktop version on the left botton -- go to: timeline
