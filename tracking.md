#### App Feedback: 
        1. we want to know how did the app usage influenced your phone: keep track of your battery level by 
        documenting the % within a specific time frame when your phone isn't connected to a power source ( e.g 30 min or 1 hr). 
        Use the spreadsheet to keep record of the start and end time you paid attention of your battery level. 
        2. any bugs you faced using the / registration 
        3. any suggestions you have in mind?
