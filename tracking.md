#### As part of MapMob testing, we are looking to colllect data on geolocation across platforms. But we can only do so if we have people tracking! 
        Plan is for the team to track for a week, it doesn't mean you need to track for an entire week, 2-3 days would be 
        really helpful for us!
        Here are instructions on how to activate two types of tracking in your phone. The first one is Google Timeline , which is (as you
        maybe guessed) a Google product. For those of you who aren't familiar with it, when using this tool google will constantly know 
        your exact location! :) If you put creepiness aside this tool is actually quite cool and can identify places you've been to as 
        well as the mode of transportation you used with exact time stamps.  You can view it later on your app and even download your own 
        data. 

The second tracking mode is an app called MapMob, which we are working on within the mHealth team along with our collaborators. This app is tracking your location with 3 minutes intervals, and later using an encrypted server to store the data.

#### 2. Allow Google Timeline: 
        - download both google maps and the google app
        - in your phone settings - google maps --> location --> choose always
        - google app - press on the left corner of the page (your photo) 
        - privacy --> location --> location reporting -choose--> report from this device - done

     *   make sure your gmail account is the same in the app and online
     **  to see your timeline, go to the desktop version on the left botton -- go to: timeline 

#### App Feedback: 
        1. we want to know how did the app usage influenced your phone: keep track of your battery level by 
        documenting the % within a specific time frame when your phone isn't connected to a power source ( e.g 30 min or 1 hr). 
        Use the spreadsheet to keep record of the start and end time you paid attention of your battery level. 
        2. any bugs you faced using the / registration 
        3. any suggestions you have in mind?
